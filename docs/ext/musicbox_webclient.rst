The first web client for Mopidy, made with jQuery Mobile by Wouter van Wijk.
Also the web client used for Wouter's popular `Pi Musicbox

    With Mopidy MusicBox Webclient, you can play your music on your computer
    (Raspberry Pi) and remotely control it from a computer, phone, tablet,
    laptop. From your couch.

    This is a responsive HTML/JS/CSS client especially written for Mopidy, a
    music server. Responsive, so it works on desktop and mobile browsers. You
    can browse, search and play albums, artists, playlists, and it has cover
    art from Last.fm.
